# SlackBot
This app uses node.js to create a slackbot that responds to commands. Currently, this bot responsds to commands which will return a chuck norris joke, a yo mama joke, and current weather status.  This is written in JS and uses node.js as a server.  First you must go to Slack and create a work space and then create an app. I named my JokeBot.  Once created you will recieve tokens. Those will allow your code to communicate with the bot. Additionally, you need to install slackbots. I used npm i slackbots. You can use what ever package manager you already use. 

Once you have all that set up you can clone my repo and then ask your bot in your work space for jokes and weather. Additional services can be added as seen in my Discord bot.
